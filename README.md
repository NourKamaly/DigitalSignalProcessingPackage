# Digital_Signal_Processing_Package
This package is for one dimensional signal processing, including transforms like the fourier transform and the inverse fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other algorithms that help in:
1. Digitization of analog signals.
2. Filtering signals using window method (windows used : hanning, hamming, blackman).
3. Convolution of signals.
4. Extracting signals from noise using correlation.
5. Other algorithms that help clean the data.

All algorithms are built from scartch and are found in DSPComponents/Algorithms/
